# Unity - Vertex Animation Texture (VAT)
This project provides a framework for creating and managing VATs, enabling you to achieve efficient and visually appealing animations with minimal performance overhead.

## Overview
Vertex Animation Textures (VATs) are a powerful technique used in game development to animate complex objects or characters using textures to store vertex movement data. This approach is especially useful for:
- Animating large numbers of objects.
- Enabling GPU-driven animations.
- Reducing CPU overhead for animation calculations.

This project provides tools to bake VAT animations in Unity.

## Features
- VAT Baking Tool: Easily bake animations into textures from your 3D models.
- Custom Shaders: Uses Unity Shader Graph for rendering VAT animations.
- ScriptableObject Support: Manage VAT data as assets.
